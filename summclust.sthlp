{synopt:{opt absorb(varname)}}partials out this variable from the
regression before computing other statistics. This should only be used
for variables that are nested within the specified clusters. This
option is computationally faster than using {cmd: fevar}. {p_end}

{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:summclust} is a stand-alone command that summarizes
cluster variability and calculates a cluster jackknife variance
estimator. MacKinnon, Nielsen, and Webb (2023) documents it more fully
than this help file. The command calculates measures of cluster-level
influence and leverage. It can optionally calculate the effective
number of clusters. By default, it reports CV_1 and CV_3 standard
errors, and it can optionally report a CV_3J standard error. It
also, optionally, calculates additional measures of cluster-level
heterogeneity. By default, it produces a figure which can help
identify the source of cluster-level heterogeneity. Finally, it can
produce a full table of regression results.

{pstd}{cmd:summclust} by default calculates the CV_3 standard error.
With well-behaved samples, this should match the standard error
calculated using either Stata's native {cmd: jackknife: reg y x,
cluster(group)} or {cmd: reg y x, cluster(group) vce(jackknife)}
commands.  However, many samples are not well behaved. Specifically,
some of the omit-one-cluster subsamples may be singular. When they
are, {cmd:summclust} calculates two standard errors. One 
drops the singular subsamples, as the native Stata routines do. The
other uses a generalized inverse. {cmd:summclust} provides guidance as
to which standard error is likely to be more reliable. When {cmd:
regtable} is specified, and singular subsamples are present, two
versions of the regression table are displayed. Similarly, if 
{cmd:jackknife} is specified and there are singular subsamples, four
different standard errors are shown, either CV_3 or CV_3J, combined
with either the generalized inverse or one computed after
dropping the singular subsamples. 

{pstd}{cmd: nograph} suppresses creation of the figure, which is
otherwise shown by default. The figure shows four scatter plots:
leverage against observations per cluster, partial leverage against
observations per cluster, leverage against omit-one-cluster
coefficients, and partial leverage against omit-one-cluster
coefficients. This figure can be quite informative, but it is
computationally costly to produce. We therefore recommend invoking
this option after you have inspected the figure.

{pstd}
{cmd: regtable} when {cmd:jackknife} is specified, regtable uses the
CV_3J estimates to produce the regression table. Otherwise, CV_3
estimates are used.
